<h1>Tips</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px">On this page you will find tips on how to prevent wildfires that would help us make the world and our greenland a better place for us humans and the wildlife living in them. As a society we have to take care of the nature around us because it is one of the most valuable things that keep this planet going. A known fact about it is that forests span about a third of the Earth's surface, including approximately 600+ million square miles in the United States alone.  Forests support a diverse range of plants and animals by providing food, water, and shelter. Also the forest's trees and plants ensure that the Earth's temperature remains bearable and that we have adequate oxygen. Our woodlands are really important. We need trees for fuel, food, raw materials, and medicine. </p>
